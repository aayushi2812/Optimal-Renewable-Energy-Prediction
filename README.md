## 📌 Project Overview

This project develops a machine learning–driven framework that predicts the most suitable renewable energy source for any country based on key climatic, socioeconomic, and infrastructural indicators. By leveraging multiple supervised learning algorithms and dimensionality reduction techniques, the model identifies patterns in global energy-related data and provides interpretable recommendations for policy makers and sustainability planners.
